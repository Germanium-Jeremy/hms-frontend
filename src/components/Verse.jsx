                    Let your voices rise in praise and worship, for as the Psalmist said, 'Sing to the Lord a new song; sing to the Lord, all the earth'(Psalm 96:1).Â Remember that your singing is not just a performance, but a powerful form of worship and a testament to your faith. May your songs uplift spirits, unite hearts, and glorify God, bringing light and hope to all who listen
